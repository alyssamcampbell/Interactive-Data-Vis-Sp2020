        <b>As weather events in the 21st century become ever frequent and intense, more people’s livelihoods and centuries old way of life will become threatened.</b>  Natural disasters, from hurricanes to floods, put in peril the future of many cities. From sea level rise and coastal erosion to ocean acidification and soil salinization, water-related events endanger soil quality and groundwater, which in turn threatens agriculture, food supply, and food prices. Together, these could engender disastrous effects on local and global economies. Ocean oxygen depletion, ocean acidification, and sea surface temperature damage coral reefs, which threaten fish stocks and fishing practices.  In addition, desertification and drought present further risks to food and water supply. As lands become less inhabitable to meet people’s daily needs, communities will be forced to move in search of new livelihoods and safety. <b>Such a process has already begun.</b>
        <br><br>
        Measuring the effect of climate change on migration is not straight forward, and it is difficult to find accurate and up to date data on a complex and ever-changing scenario. <b>Human movement is complex, with both forced and voluntary internal and external displacement, and can be both temporary and permanent in scope.</b> As a term, "Environmental refugee” or “climate change refugee” do not carry a legal basis under international refugee law.

 The below map uses the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative’s Country Index for Climate Change Vulnerability. The ND-GAIN Country Index summarizes a country’s vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its readiness to improve resilience. It is up to date as of 3/4/2019.

          <span style="color: #1DB79B"><u><b>Map 2 - Net Migration Rate</b><br></u></span>
 The following map shows net migration rate by country for 2019. The net migration rate is calculated as the difference between the number of people coming into an area and the number of people leaving an area during a year. In other words, immigrants MINUS emigrants during a period of time. <b>Countries that tend to have a higher positive net migration rate appear in darker blue.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Countries that have a higher vulnerability to climate change also tend to have higher rates of emigration. Climate change could intensify this already existing trend.</b>

          <br>
          The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) defines a disaster as:
          <br><br>
        <center><i><span style="color: #1DB79B">“A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society at any scale due to hazardous events interacting with conditions of exposure, vulnerability and capacity, leading to one or more of the following: human, material, economic and environmental losses and impacts.”</i><br><br></center></span>
          Each year, natural disasters can displace thousands to hundreds of thousands of people, sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently. The Nansen Initiative’s Protection Agenda defines disaster displacement as:<br><br>
        <i><span style="color: #1DB79B">“Situations where people are forced or obliged to leave their homes or places of habitual residence as a result of a disaster or in order to avoid the impact of an immediate and foreseeable natural hazard. Such displacement results from the fact that affected persons are exposed to a natural hazard in a situation where they are too vulnerable and lack the resilience to withstand the impacts of that hazard. <b></b>It is the effects of natural hazards, including the adverse impacts of climate change, that may overwhelm the resilience or adaptive capacity of an affected community or society, thus leading to a disaster that potentially results in displacement.</b> Disaster displacement may take the form of spontaneous flight, an evacuation ordered or enforced by authorities or an involuntary planned relocation process. Such displacement can occur within a country (internal displacement), or across international borders (cross-border disaster-displacement).”</i></span></center>

They may also include IDPs who have attempted to return, resettle elsewhere or integrate locally but have been unable to achieve durable solutions."</i>

<i><span style ="color: #1DB79B"><center>"There is relatively little comprehensive, accurate observational time series data on the number of people displaced before, during and after such as event. Many figures reported during the emergency phase cannot be verified and subsequently prove to be inaccurate. There is also little data collection on outflows associated with disaster displacement. It is difficult, for example, to ascertain when people leave evacuation centres or where they go. It is usually simply assumed that they have returned to their homes. Nor is it possible to assess their vulnerabilities, which represents an obstacle to response."</i></span></center>
